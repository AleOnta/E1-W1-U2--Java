# E1-W1-U2--Java

This is the first exercise of the Epicode Bootcamp facing Spring Framework in Java.
We were instructed to build a program to simulate a pizza shop.
The project was built and achieved by using Eclipse IDE - and additional libraries such as Spring web Tools 4 & Lombok project.

To complete this project, i've decided to adopt the 'decorator pattern' for the creation of the differents types of pizza.
I've also configurated the Spring project by ConfigurationFile present in com.spring.menu_configuration package.
